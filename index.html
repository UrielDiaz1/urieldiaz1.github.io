    <h1>Hornet HFD</h1>
    <p><strong>Hornets HFD</strong> is set in the near feature where an explosion of brush fires is wreaking havoc in
        our community.
        Fires are spontaneously erupting all over campus. You will pick up water from the American River and use that
        water to fight fires throughout the campus. You will have to make repeated trips back to the river to get more
        water and the fires will continue to grow in size until they are fully extinguished. You also need to avoid
        other objects, such as the a <strong>NPC helicopter</strong>, and manage your fuel and other resources carefully
        in order to
        win the game. The player has partial control on the <strong>NPC helicopter</strong>, where you can only decide
        which fire the
        NPC helicopter should prioritize. However, the player will have no control of how the NPC helicopter
        extinguishes the fires. It is possible to crash against the <strong>NPC helicopter</strong>, which loses the
        game. However, the
        <strong>NPC helicopter</strong> has multiple strategies, including an avoidance strategy that attempts to
        prevent a crash.
